<h3>Add a library</h3>
<p>Please be careful when entering the path. Though some validation is done, it will happily let you enter potentially sensitive paths. 
There is no autocomplete either - it's strongly suggested that you copy the path from somewhere.</p>

    <label for="library_location">Path to library</label>
