# Foliate (modified bundle)

Current version: `9fc0b62803dc72abb95cf94604e19f94d2b7c621`

Changes:
* Remove all non-JS, non-license files (vendored libraries are untouched)
* Remove `reader.html` and `reader.js` (unused)

<sub>Git submodules are avoided to avoid filtering the static directory, or doing other misc. cursed shit, and to avoid dealing with Git submodules, which are frankly infuriating to work with</sub>
