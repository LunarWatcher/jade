# Migrations

This folder is a ✨ special ✨ folder that contains migrations. Names are in the following pattern: `<Numeric ID, prefixed with a 0 for IDs under 10><ShorhandIdentifier>.hpp`

Migrations should never reach the point where triple digits are a concern. At some point in the future, the migration system will be changed to allow for migration consolidation, where all the migrations are just squished into a single one. For now, however, I do not wish to deal with this.
