# Libraries

Libraries can be configured by admins, and  take a single path to a directory containing the ebooks. 

Libraries are one of a very few exceptions where the path name matters. The library name is currently equal to the name of the folder. This may change in the future if there's any interest in it.

Library metadata can be configured after the fact by admins, though at the time of writing, there's no configurable library metadata.
